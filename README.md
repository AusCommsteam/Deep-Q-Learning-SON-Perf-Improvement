# Deep-Q-Learning-SON-Perf-Improvement

The requirement for running this code is to obtain license and access of the Vienna LTE-A simulator, found at: https://www.nt.tuwien.ac.at/research/mobile-communications/vccs/vienna-lte-a-simulators/

MATLAB, Python 3, TensorFlow are all required.

An important file LTE_sim_main.m is missing since it is part of the Vienna LTE-A simulator.  I had to modify this file to enable alarms, but of course cannot share the file due to copyrights.
